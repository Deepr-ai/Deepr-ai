## What is DeeprAI?
DeeperAI is a beginner-friendly neural network library developed in Python and Cython, which aims to be simple and easy to use. DeeprAI is made for a level 0 introduction to machine learning, helping others to gain a firm understanding of the core concepts and to prepare them for more advanced frameworks (which DeeprAI might make in the future).
## Documentation
The documentation for DeeprAI is still under construction, but you can check it out here:

## What makes Deepr-ai different from other machine-learning libraries?
Deepr-ai's incredibly easy and simple setup means that it requires almost no previous knowledge in Python, math, or machine learning to set up a model. However, there are more advanced settings as well (for more experienced users).
## Is Deepr-ai finished?
Currently, DeeprAI is under development. Regular updates are planned (granted I'm in university so updates might be delayed). However, DeeprAI still has useful features and practical uses in its unfinished form.
