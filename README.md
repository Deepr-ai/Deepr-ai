## What is Deepr-ai?
Deeper-ai is a beginner-friendly neural network library developed in Python and Cython, which aims to be simple and easy to use. Deepr-ai is made for a level 0 introduction to machine learning, helping others to gain a firm understanding of the core concepts and to prepare them for more advanced frameworks (which DeeprAI might make in the future).
## Documentation
The documentation for Deepr-ai is still under construction, but you can check it out here:

## What makes Deepr-ai different from other machine-learning libraries?
Deepr-ai's incredibly easy and simple setup means that it requires almost no previous knowledge in Python, math, or machine learning to set up a model. However, there are more advanced settings as well (for more experienced users).
## Is Deepr-ai finished?
Currently, DeeprAI is under development. Regular updates are planned (granted I'm in high school so updates might be delayed). However, DeeprAI still has useful features and practical uses in its unfinished form.
